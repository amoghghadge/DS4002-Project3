## Dataset Acquisition

The dataset used for the EDA and analysis can be downloaded at this link: https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html

Under the "Downloads" section, click on "1. Dataset images" to download the images, and click on "4. The image labels" to download the classification indicators of corresponding flowers in the image dataset. The original image labels (numeric data type) are also included in the current folder titled "flowerimagelabels.csv" as well as a converted version that has the actual names of the flower types (character data type).
